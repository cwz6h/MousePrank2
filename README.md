Mouse Prank Except It Is The Second One

## Yep, It Is The Second One, Written In C++
The Original Mouse Prank Was Written In C And Would Simply Print A Message And Move Your Mouse. But This One Comes A Little More Brutal With The Cursor. Making It Look Like The Cursor Is Cloned. It Is Also More Harder To Move The Cursor.

## Introduction
Mouse Prank Would Simply Move Your Cursor And Basically Play A Joke On You. But The New One Written In C++ Warns You With An Error That If The OK Button Is Pressed (Or If The Window Was Closed) It Would Move Your Cursor A Bit More Brutal
